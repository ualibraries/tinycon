## Kinds of things to share

* Is there anything you do as part of your daily work that others may not know about? If it would help others to know, share it here.
* If you do 10% time, what are you learning about? If at least one other person would be interested, it's probably valuable to share.
* What new thing have you learned in the past week? A new way to manage your time or plan your tasks? Something new in your field of work?
* Is there a thing that you know how to do that you wish more people knew how to do? Let them know how!
* Have you read any interesting articles or books in your field of expertise recently? Share a summary and let us know your favorite takeaways.
* What tools do you use in your daily work? Let everyone look over your shoulder by doing a live demo.

For anything you're sharing, consider what takeaways you hope people can get from your topic. And for anything you're sharing; prepare your material if it's helpful to you, but remember that it's also helpful for others to see how you might approach and solve a problem. It's OK if you stumble through.
